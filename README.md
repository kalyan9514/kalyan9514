# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kalyan!

## ðŸš€ About Me  
With over 5 years of expertise in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Quality Engineering, I have built and deployed high-impact AI solutions that drive measurable business outcomes in E-Commerce, Last-Mile Delivery (B2B & B2C), and Healthcare AI. I specialize in demand forecasting, fraud detection, anomaly detection, and AI-driven automation, leveraging ML model deployment, cloud platforms (GCP, AWS), and MLOps to create scalable and production-ready systems.

At Dunzo, I led the development of predictive ETA and dynamic routing models using reinforcement learning and graph algorithms, optimizing delivery operations across 150+ dark stores, increasing ETA accuracy by 11%, and boosting fulfillment speed. My fraud detection pipeline processed 1M+ monthly transactions, reduced false positives by 15%, and enabled real-time alerting, saving 100+ engineering hours weekly. I also developed demand forecasting models using ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM for 600+ SKUs, cutting stockouts by 5% and improving shelf-life by 20%. These models, embedded into automated pipelines via Airflow on GCP, directly contributed to over $3M in annual revenue.

Beyond modeling, I engineered scalable data pipelines with SQL, Python, Airflow, and Kafka, and deployed ML systems using FastAPI, Flask, and Kubernetes, ensuring low-latency, high-availability APIs across cloud-native environments.

With a strong foundation in Quality Engineering, I streamlined CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Selenium, executed 100,000+ automated test runs, and created SQL-based data validations to enhance system reliability by 40% and reduce QA cycle time by 30%.

My strength lies in bridging AI innovation with business strategy, delivering solutions aligned with GTM initiatives, fraud prevention, and operational intelligence, and ensuring seamless cross-functional collaboration and real-world impact.
