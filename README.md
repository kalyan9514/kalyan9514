# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kalyan!

## ðŸš€ About Me  
Hi, Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience building and deploying AI solutions across e-commerce, logistics, and healthcare. I focus on creating real-world impact through machine learning, MLOps, and data engineering.

What I do best:

Demand forecasting using ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM

Fraud detection and anomaly detection at scale

ML deployment and automation with FastAPI, Airflow, Docker, and Kubernetes

Cloud platforms: GCP and AWS

Highlights from my work at Dunzo:

Built predictive ETA and dynamic routing models using reinforcement learning and graph algorithms â€” improved delivery speed and ETA accuracy across 150+ dark stores

Designed a real-time fraud detection pipeline for 1M+ transactions per month â€” reduced false positives by 15% and saved 100+ engineering hours per week

Developed demand forecasting for 600+ SKUs â€” reduced stockouts by 5%, improved shelf-life by 20%, and contributed over $2M in revenue

Engineered end-to-end ML pipelines using SQL, Python, Kafka, and Airflow

Earlier in my career:

As a Quality Engineer, improved system reliability by 40% through automated testing (Selenium, Jenkins) and CI/CD enhancements

Reduced QA cycle time by 30% and executed over 100,000 automated test runs

Iâ€™m passionate about aligning AI with business strategy â€” whether itâ€™s enabling GTM growth, optimizing operations, or enhancing customer experience.
