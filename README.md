# Hi there 👋, I'm Kalyan!

## 🚀 About Me  
Hi, I’m a Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience building and deploying AI solutions across e-commerce, logistics, and healthcare. I focus on creating real-world impact through machine learning, MLOps, and data engineering.

What I do best:

Demand Forecasting using ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM

Fraud Detection and Anomaly Detection at scale

ML Deployment & Automation with FastAPI, Airflow, Docker, and Kubernetes

Cloud Platforms: GCP & AWS

Highlights from my work at Dunzo:

Built predictive ETA and dynamic routing models using Reinforcement Learning and Graph Algorithms → improved delivery speed and ETA accuracy across 150+ dark stores

Designed a real-time fraud detection pipeline for 1M+ transactions/month → reduced false positives by 15% and saved 100+ engineering hours/week

Developed demand forecasting for 600+ SKUs → reduced stockouts by 5%, improved shelf-life by 20%, and contributed $2M+ in revenue

Engineered end-to-end ML pipelines using SQL, Python, Kafka, and Airflow

Earlier in my career:

As a Quality Engineer, improved system reliability by 40% through automated testing (Selenium, Jenkins) and CI/CD enhancements

Reduced QA cycle time by 30% and executed over 100,000+ test runs

I'm passionate about aligning AI with business strategy—whether it’s enabling GTM growth, optimizing operations, or enhancing customer experience.
