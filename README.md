# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kalyan!

## ðŸš€ About Me  
With over **5 years of expertise** in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Quality Engineering**, I have built and deployed **high-impact AI solutions** that drive measurable business outcomes in **E-Commerce, Last-Mile Delivery (B2B & B2C), and Healthcare AI**. I specialize in **demand forecasting, fraud detection, anomaly detection, and AI-driven automation**, leveraging **ML model deployment, cloud platforms (GCP, AWS), and MLOps** to create **scalable and production-ready systems**. My **ML-based demand forecasting model** has transformed **inventory planning and category optimization**, increasing revenue, improving **shelf life by 20%**, and reducing **wastage by 5%**. Additionally, I **automated fraud detection** for a **B2C platform**, cutting **false positives by 15%**, saving **100+ hours weekly**, and enhancing **customer retention and financial security** through **real-time risk assessment**.

Beyond model development, I specialize in **data engineering, automation, and AI deployment**, building **scalable data pipelines** with **SQL, Spark, Airflow, and Kafka** to optimize real-time processing. I have successfully **deployed ML models into production** using **FastAPI, Flask, and Kubernetes**, ensuring **high availability, low latency, and seamless API integration**. With a strong background in **Quality Engineering**, I have streamlined **CI/CD automation, regression testing, and data validation**, improving **system reliability by 40%** using **Python, Selenium, and Jenkins**. My expertise lies in **bridging AI innovation with business strategy**, aligning **ML solutions with GTM initiatives, fraud prevention, and AI-driven business intelligence**, and ensuring **seamless AI adoption and cross-functional impact**.
