# Hi there 👋, I'm Kalyan!

## 🚀 About Me  
Hi, I’m an ML Engineer with 5+ years of experience building and deploying AI solutions across e-commerce, logistics, and healthcare. I focus on creating real-world impact through machine learning, MLOps, and data engineering.

**What I do best:**

- Demand forecasting using ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM
- Fraud detection and anomaly detection at scale
- ML deployment and automation with FastAPI, Airflow, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Cloud platforms: GCP and AWS

**Highlights from my work at Dunzo:**

- Built predictive ETA and dynamic routing models using reinforcement learning and graph algorithms — improved delivery speed and ETA accuracy across 150+ dark stores
- Designed a real-time fraud detection pipeline for 1M+ transactions per month — reduced false positives by 15% and saved 100+ engineering hours per week
- Developed demand forecasting for 600+ SKUs — reduced stockouts by 5%, improved shelf-life by 20%, and contributed over $2M in revenue
- Engineered end-to-end ML pipelines using SQL, Python, Kafka, and Airflow

**Earlier in my career:**

- As a Quality Engineer, improved system reliability by 40% through automated testing (Selenium, Jenkins) and CI/CD enhancements
- Reduced QA cycle time by 30% and executed over 100,000 automated test runs

I’m passionate about aligning AI with business strategy — whether it’s enabling GTM growth, optimizing operations, or enhancing customer experience.
